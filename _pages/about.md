title: "so what is crowdhaüs?"
---

If you've gotten this far, you've made a good start. We are about to take you behind the curtain for a little insight into who we are.

The company came about as a result of our founders' frustrating experiences whilst searching for a new home. If you pass a property you like, why is it so difficult to get any information about it?

It's clear that digital natives have been ignored by the major players in the property search market, and our digital smart sign has been designed to match the experience they expect across other markets - think news, social media, dating and even banking!

By providing a service that aims to target this mismatch, agents and users will benefit from instant information, and simple communication. A digital experience providing hyperlocalised information, in a familiar, digestible format - think Tinder, think Happn… think crowdhaüs.
